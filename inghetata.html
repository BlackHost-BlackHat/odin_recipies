    <h3>I scream, you scream, we all scream for HOMEMADE ice cream! This sweet treat is rich, creamy, packed with vanilla flavor, and insanely easy to make.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream </strong> It creates the rich ice cream base. For a dairy-free alternative, check out this vegan ice cream recipe!</li>
        <li><strong>Whole milk </strong> I don't recommend replacing it with reduced fat or skim. Whole milk's higher fat content ensures that the homemade ice cream comes out creamy, not icy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cane sugar</strong>  For sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>  For warm vanilla flavor. If you happen to have vanilla bean paste on hand, it's a fun alternative. It gives the ice cream the same rich vanilla flavor, plus a speckled vanilla bean appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>And salt</strong>  To make all the flavors pop!</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First thing’s first! At least 12 hours before you want to make homemade ice cream, freeze the bowl of your ice cream maker. It needs to be fully chilled in order for the ice cream to firm up.</li>
        <li>Next, make the ice cream base. I recommend doing this step anywhere from 2 to 24 hours in advance. If you do it less than 2 hours ahead, the ice cream won’t thicken as nicely when you churn it.</li>
        <li>Combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Warm for 5 minutes, whisking often, until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is warmed through.</li>
        <li>Then, chill the ice cream base. Transfer it to a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
